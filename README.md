## Overview

The portfolio serves as a comprehensive introduction to my skills and experience as a front-end developer. Each section, including **Home**, **About**, **Projects**, and **Contact**, is accessible through a fully responsive navigation bar. This project not only highlights my front-end capabilities but also demonstrates my ability to create a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: The navbar adjusts automatically across different screen sizes and closes when a link is clicked in mobile view.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Links in the navigation bar take users to the appropriate section with smooth scrolling for enhanced user experience.
- **Section-Based Layout**: Organized sections for easy navigation:
  - **Home**: Introduction and welcome section.
  - **About**: Background and core front-end skills.
  - **Projects**: Showcase of my recent projects and work.
  - **Contact**: Contact form for reaching out.
- **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: Aesthetic design created with minimal custom CSS, focusing on Tailwind’s utility-first classes for streamlined styling.
- **React & TypeScript**: Written with TypeScript for type safety, ensuring fewer bugs and improved code readability.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building component-based UIs.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and code reliability.
